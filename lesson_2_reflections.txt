reflections for lesson 2 
here we are into more depth of creating the repository and using merge and branch 
git add files, files are added to tracking mode ie, staging ,  for commiting to repository 
after that commit it using git commit and add a commit message in the editor so that it will come in the log and easy 
then after that use git status to show the status it will show no files to commit since we have committed it , 
then use the git diff --staged to find the staged and working directory anything is changed or not

After that we have learned how to branch to a new repository for making changes from a commmon master then work on different experiments on same projects without affecting the original 
using git branch "branch name"
later on how to merge two branch to single one to introduce both features from branches. using git merge branch1 branch2 this will merge changes to checkout branch.
later how we did resolve git merge conflicts by manually going to file that had conflicts and resolved it in a editor and removed git special comments in the process then added the file to dtaging using git add , which reports both files changed .
and continue and conclude the merge using git commit.

this lesson i had to struggle a lot to make things work since got errors in merging and also while doing the exercises made things clearer . reviewing the videos will defintely help.

thanks.
